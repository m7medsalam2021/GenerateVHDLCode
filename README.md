Generate VHDL Code

This project is designed to help generate VHDL code for various digital circuits such as multiplexers, decoders, encoders, and shift registers. It aims to provide a flexible and easy way to create hardware description language code based on user inputs.

Features

Supports multiple digital components (MUX, DEMUX, Decoder, Encoder, SIPO, PISO, etc.).

Generates clean, customizable VHDL code.

Interactive prompts for optional control signals like clock (clk), reset (rst), enable (en), and mode.

Dynamic handling of input/output sizes.

Getting Started

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open your preferred IDE or text editor.

Modify or use the provided scripts to generate the VHDL code you need.

Use Git commands to version control your changes.
